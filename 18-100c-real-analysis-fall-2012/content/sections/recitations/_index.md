The writing assignments and LaTeX exercises below were developed and refined by a succession of instructors in the MIT Department of Mathematics. These resources, and many others, are available on the [MathDL Mathematical Communications](http://mathcomm.org/) website. This public site is hosted by the [Mathematical Association of America](http://www.maa.org/) as part of the Mathematical Digital Sciences Library ([MathDL](http://mathdl.maa.org/)).

Grading Policy
--------------

Work completed for 18.100C's recitation will account for 25% of your total grade. 180 points will be distributed in the following fashion:

| ASSIGNMENTS | POINTS |
| --- | --- |
| Writing Assignment 1 | 20 |
| Writing Assignment 2 | 35 |
| Writing Assignment 3 | 35 |
| LaTeX Exercise 1 | 15 |
| LaTeX Exercise 2 | 15 |
| Peer review 1 and Connectivity assignment | 15 |
| Peer review 2 | 15 |
| P-set problems writing (LaTeX) | 30 

Attendance Policy
-----------------

Class attendance is mandatory. Because this is a discussion class, you are expected to be present in class and prepared to contribute. A note is required from a dean for an absence to be excused. Every unexcused absence of the first two will lower your recitations grade by 25 points. The third absence will make you fail 18.100C recitations, hence 18.100C.

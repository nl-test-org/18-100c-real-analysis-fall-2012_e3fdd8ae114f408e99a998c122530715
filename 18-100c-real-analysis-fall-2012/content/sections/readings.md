| LEC # | TOPICS | READINGS |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Sets, ordered sets, countable sets | pp. 3–6, and 24–30;  {{< br >}}Theorem 2.14 makes good reading even though it wasn't covered in class. |
| 2 | Fields, ordered fields, least upper bounds, the real numbers | pp. 5–11 |
| 3 | The Archimedean principle; decimal expansion; intersections of closed intervals; complex numbers, Cauchy-Schwarz |  {{< br >}}{{< br >}} pp. 38–9 (Theorem 2.38 only), 41 (Corollary to Theorem 2.43 only), and 12–6 {{< br >}}{{< br >}} {{< h 3 >}}Independent Reading:{{< /h >}} {{< br >}}{{< br >}} pp. 16–7 (Euclidean spaces) {{< br >}}{{< br >}}  |
| 4 | Metric spaces, ball neighborhoods, open subsets | pp. 30–4 |
| 5 | Open subsets, limit points, closed subsets, dense subsets | pp. 34–46 |
| 6 | Compact subsets of metric spaces | pp. 36–8, and Problem 26 from p. 45 |
| 7 | Limit points and compactness; compactness of closed bounded subsets in Euclidean space | pp. 38–40 |
| 8 | Convergent sequences in metric spaces; Cauchy sequences, completeness; Cauchy's theorem | pp. 47–9, and 51 (bottom of the page) –55 |

| 10 | Absolute convergence, product of series | pp. 71–4, and 78 |
| 11 | Power series, convergence radius; the exponential function, sine and cosine | pp. 69–70 plus some additional material from Chapter 8 (notably pages 178–80 on the exponential series, but covered only partially). |
| 12 | Continuous maps between metric spaces; images of compact subsets; continuity of inverse maps | pp. 83–9 |

| 22 | Fundamental theorem of calculus; back to power series: continuity, differentiability | pp. 133–4, and the parts of Theorem 8.1 which we didn't do before. |
| 23 | Review of exponential, log, sine, cosine; _eit\= cos(t)_ + _isin(t)_ | pp. 178–84 |
| 24 | Review of series, Fourier series |
